Write the definition of a function named  newbie that receives no parameters  and returns true  the first time it is invoked (when it is a "newbie"), and that returns false  every time that it is invoked after that. 

bool newbie ()
{
    static int i=0;
    i++;
    return ( (i==1) ? true : false);
}
